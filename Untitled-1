What I still want to do with this page:
    - Make the image link to the details page  
    - Make the details page show the right painting and information about that painting
    - Add a menu to refresh the page displaying only certain paintings
            = according to a date selection
            = according to size (width/height)
            = according to painter
            = alphabetically
            = by year of painting 


Make sure to delete this file before I push



The next project was a flash-card game:
    - Allow the user to select different categories to be tested only
    - See flash card 
    - Click it and see the answer
    - Move to the next question
    - Select number of questions that you want to be tested on
    - Make it into a reverse test
        - be shown definitions
        - Type the answer in or choose from four different answers
    
    - Be able to save my own results (locally)
    - Be able to view my own results over time
    - See my results as a chart over time
    - Be able to add my own questions and answers to the quiz
        - select the category of the question
        - create new categories

    For starters:
    - make list of questions = answers
